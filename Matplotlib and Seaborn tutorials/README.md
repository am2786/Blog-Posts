This file contains tutorials for the data visualization packages [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/). As always I've placed a link on [how to install matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html) as well as a link for  [how to install seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html), although I'm pretty sure these come automatically when installing Anaconda.
